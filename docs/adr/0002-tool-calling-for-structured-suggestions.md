# Suggestions use forced tool calling over any OpenAI-compatible API

Suggestions come from the chat completions API with a single `suggest_domains` tool forced via `tool_choice`, so the reply is always structured JSON. Talia talks only to OpenAI-compatible endpoints (configurable base URL), which covers OpenAI, Gemini, and local models without per-provider code.

## Considered Options

- **`response_format` structured output**: less consistently supported across providers than tool calling.
- **Provider-specific SDKs**: more features, but each provider becomes its own code path.

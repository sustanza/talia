# Configuration Reference

All CLI flags, environment variables, and `.env` file support.

## CLI Flags

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--whois` | string | — | WHOIS server in `host:port` format. Required for domain checking |
| `--sleep` | duration | `2s` | Delay between sequential WHOIS checks. Ignored in parallel mode |
| `--verbose` | bool | `false` | Include raw WHOIS response in `log` field for all results |
| `--grouped-output` | bool | `false` | Output as `{available:[], unavailable:[]}` instead of array |
| `--output-file` | string | — | Separate file for grouped output (leaves input unchanged) |
| `--suggest` | int | `0` | Number of AI suggestions to generate per request |
| `--suggest-parallel` | int | `1` | Number of concurrent AI suggestion requests |
| `--prompt` | string | — | Natural language prompt to guide AI suggestions |
| `--model` | string | `gpt-5-mini` | AI model name |
| `--api-base` | string | — | Base URL for OpenAI-compatible API |
| `--fresh` | bool | `false` | Don't send existing domains as exclusions to AI |
| `--clean` | bool | `false` | Normalize/deduplicate domains in the file, then exit |
| `--no-verify` | bool | `false` | Skip WHOIS verification after generating suggestions |
| `--merge` | bool | `false` | Merge multiple domain files with deduplication |
| `-o` | string | — | Output file for `--merge` |
| `--export-available` | string | — | Export available domains to a plain text file |
| `--lightspeed` | string | — | Parallel WHOIS: `"max"`, a positive integer, or empty for sequential. Any other value exits with an error |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Fallback for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `TALIA_FILE` | positional arg | Target file path |
| `WHOIS_SERVER` | `--whois` | WHOIS server `host:port` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | Required for `--suggest`. No flag equivalent |
| `OPENAI_API_BASE` | `--api-base` | Falls back to `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| `TALIA_SUGGEST` | `--suggest` | Ignored if file has pending `unverified` domains |
| `TALIA_SUGGEST_PARALLEL` | `--suggest-parallel` | Number of parallel AI requests |
| `TALIA_PROMPT` | `--prompt` | Extra context for AI suggestions |
| `TALIA_MODEL` | `--model` | AI model name |
| `TALIA_LIGHTSPEED` | `--lightspeed` | Parallel WHOIS worker count; invalid values exit with an error |
| `NO_COLOR` | — | Any non-empty value disables colored output ([no-color.org](https://no-color.org)) |

### `.env` File

Talia loads a `.env` file from the current working directory at startup.

Example `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai
WHOIS_SERVER=whois.verisign-grs.com:43
TALIA_PROMPT=short brandable startup names
TALIA_SUGGEST=10
TALIA_MODEL=gemini-3.1-flash-lite
TALIA_FILE=suggestions.json
```

Rules:

- Does **not** override existing shell environment variables.
- Supports `KEY=VALUE` format (matching quotes — both `"` or both `'` — are stripped from values).
- Lines without `=` are silently skipped.
- No inline comment stripping — `KEY=value # comment` sets the value to `value # comment` (the full right-hand side).
- A variable set to empty string in the shell (`export KEY=""`) counts as "existing" and will not be overwritten.
- Silently ignored if the file doesn't exist.

### Explicit Flags Always Win

`TALIA_MODEL`, `TALIA_SUGGEST_PARALLEL` and `TALIA_SUGGEST` apply only when their flag is not passed. Passing the flag explicitly, even with its default value (`--model=gpt-5-mini`, `--suggest-parallel=1`, `--suggest=0`), overrides the env var. String flags such as `--prompt`, `--api-base` and `--whois` fall back to their env var whenever they are empty.

### `--sleep` During Auto-Verification

The `--sleep` flag is ignored during the auto-verification step after `--suggest`. Auto-verification uses a hardcoded 100ms delay between WHOIS checks for speed. The `--sleep` value only applies to standalone WHOIS checking runs.

## Behavior Notes

### Check errors

A failed check does not abort the run: the domain is recorded as unavailable with reason `ERROR` and the error text in `log` (regardless of `--verbose`). The exit code is `0` as long as the file is written.

Progress lines and the summary are colored only when stdout is a terminal. Piped or redirected output, and any run with `NO_COLOR` set to a non-empty value, has no ANSI escape codes.

### Normalization

Every suggestion, cleaned domain, and merged domain is normalized:

| Rule | Example |
|---|---|
| Lowercase and trim whitespace | `" Example.COM "` → `"example.com"` |
| Strip repeated `.com` suffixes | `"foo.com.com.com"` → `"foo.com"` |
| Collapse double dots | `"foo..com"` → `"foo.com"` |
| Must end with `.com` | `"foo.io"` → rejected |
| No subdomains | `"sub.foo.com"` → rejected |
| Label is `[a-z0-9-]`, no leading/trailing hyphen | `"-foo.com"` → rejected |

### `--clean`

- Valid JSON is cleaned as a grouped file; anything else as plain text, one domain per line.
- In grouped files, duplicates are resolved in bucket order available → unavailable → unverified, so a domain in both `available` and `unverified` keeps the `available` entry.
- In plain text, blank lines and lines starting with `#` are skipped, the first occurrence wins, and input order is preserved.

### Merging

`--merge` keeps the first occurrence of each domain; `--output-file` with `--grouped-output` keeps the newest result. See [ADR-0005](../adr/0005-two-merge-semantics.md).
